# Horiseon


##Made with love by Ben:)


###This is the refactored code for Horiseon, in this challenge I...
-Got rid of repetitive code
-Removed/replaced div elements
-Set alt values so the screen readers would NOT read the images, (as I felt they did not add any content to the page).
-Rearranged CSS and element classes to reflect the newly replaced divs
